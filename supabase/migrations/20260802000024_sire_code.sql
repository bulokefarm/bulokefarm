-- Buloke Farm — a sire identified by tag, not only by name
-- Apply after 20260802000023_species_on_reports.sql.
--
-- v_animal_current reads sire_name straight from sire.name. Your
-- cattle sires are named — 'Bre. Quicksilver (P)', 'M. Umberto U3' —
-- so it has always looked right. The rams aren't: they are known by
-- their tag, TOL 20-P1065, and name is null. So every sheep node in
-- the family tree reported "no pedigree" while pointing at a sire
-- that was recorded perfectly well.
--
-- The dam already had this covered — dam_code and dam_name both come
-- through. The sire only ever got the name. Now it gets both, and
-- sire_name falls back to the tag so nothing that reads it today has
-- to change to benefit.
